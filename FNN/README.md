## FNN
Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB) is a large unconstrained face database consisting of 34512 images of 100 Indian actors collected from more than 100 videos. All the images are manually selected and cropped from the video frames resulting in a high degree of variability in terms of scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, resolution, occlusion, and makeup.
## First
For this assignment a simplified and restructured subset of the dataset is loaded HERE(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQ6ozmlUvcPNT_AEFDSICfIxkY4R8Zf3/view?usp=sharing) to give you a total 19906 files belonging to 3 classes (Young, Middle, Old).
## Second
You can refer to the following guide explaining how to load datasets from various sources to Google Colab: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-informative-colab-guide-to-load-image-datasets-from-github-kaggle-and-local-machine-75cae89ffa1e

‚óè For this assignment I will build a feedforward neural network to detect the age class (Young, Middle, Old) of the person in the image, which should not be a convolutional neural network, which is one of the most widely used network for image classification
